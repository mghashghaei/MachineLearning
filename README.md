Implementing K-means Clustering for Image Compression
In this project, part of my coursework, I explored the implementation and application of the K-means clustering algorithm. The goal was two-fold: first, to understand the workings of K-means in clustering data points; and second, to apply this algorithm to a practical scenario of image compression. Below, I outline the steps taken, the challenges faced, and the outcomes of this fascinating exploration.

Overview of K-means Clustering
K-means is a widely used algorithm in unsupervised learning, particularly for clustering tasks. It aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This method involves:

Randomly initializing k centroids, each representing the center of a cluster.
Iteratively performing two steps:
Assigning each data point to the closest centroid.
Recomputing the centroids as the mean of all points assigned to each centroid.
The algorithm terminates when the assignments no longer change, ideally minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares.

Implementation Details
Setting Up the Environment
The project begins with the setup of the necessary Python libraries:

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from utils import *

%matplotlib inline
Phase 1: Finding Closest Centroids
The first task was to implement the function find_closest_centroids, which assigns each training example to its nearest centroid. The pseudocode provided outlines the iterative process of centroid assignment and update:

centroids = kMeans_init_centroids(X, K)
for iter in range(iterations):
    idx = find_closest_centroids(X, centroids)
    centroids = compute_centroids(X, idx, K)
Phase 2: Computing New Centroids
Following the assignment of points to the nearest centroids, the next step involved computing the new centroids by averaging the data points in each cluster:

def compute_centroids(X, idx, K):
    # Implementation details
This function recalculates the centroid positions based on the current assignments, ensuring the centroids move towards the cluster means.

Application to Image Compression
The practical application of K-means in this project involved image compression. The idea is to reduce the number of colors in an image by clustering similar colors together. This process involves treating each pixel's color as a point in a three-dimensional space (RGB) and finding a reduced set of colors that best represents the image.

The Process
Dataset Preparation: Loading the image and preparing the data.
Applying K-means: Using K-means to find the most representative colors.
Image Reconstruction: Mapping each pixel's color to the closest centroid and reconstructing the image with the reduced color palette.
Results and Conclusion
The application of K-means to image compression successfully demonstrated the algorithm's utility in reducing the image's color space while preserving the essence of the visual content. This not only provided a practical understanding of K-means but also showcased its potential in optimizing storage and transmission of digital images.

In conclusion, this project not only reinforced my understanding of K-means clustering but also allowed me to apply this knowledge to a practical problem, offering insights into the algorithm's applications beyond theoretical exercises.
