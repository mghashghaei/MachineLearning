I successfully completed my task for Professor Farhad Abbasi Amiri’s Machine Learning class. The assignment centered around the application of linear regression and gradient descent techniques to analyze a dataset concerning a city and a restaurant franchise. My exploration involved investigating the cost function and other pertinent concepts. For further insights, you can find my assignment on GitHub.

Throughout the project, I delved deeply into the intricacies of linear regression and gradient descent. These methods were utilized to establish a model that could effectively predict restaurant profits based on various city attributes. By gaining a comprehensive understanding of the cost function, I aimed to optimize the model’s predictive capabilities and improve its accuracy in forecasting profits for the franchise.
